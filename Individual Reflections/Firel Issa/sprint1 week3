My individual reflection for week 3:


This week, on Monday we had our first meeting with one of the supervisors. He told us that we should improve some things that we were wrong about. We had decided to start coding week 3, but he told us that we can wait with the code and start coding week 4 instead. We found out that we made some mistakes with our backlog. We decided to have a new deadline for our individual reflection, namely on Sundays until 23:59 instead of Fridays. 

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get a better understanding about how the programming language does work in Android-studio, namely a special java version and XML. I want to get a broader knowledge of the Android-studio to be able to handle it in a good way and at the same time to be able to handle the various problems that we may encounter. In addition, I absolutely want to start to start with making the code foundation for our application with the team. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Some members in the group had a problem with their pcs when they tried to print the “Helloworld” in their Android-studio, so I tried to help them with fixing the problem, because it worked on my pc. Good cooperation is needed for the team work to be able to move forward. So far, the collaboration is working very well in our group. Everyone tries to help each other as best they can. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
All the group members participate in solving the problems we get. We tried to help each other with solving the problems we had, and we got some tips about solving the problems from the supervisor. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The whole group members did a README file containing “Helloworld” that we did in Android-studio and I actually got help from the other group members. It wasn't so difficult!
