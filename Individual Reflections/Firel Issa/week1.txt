Our group consists of 6 persons. I'm Firel Issa, one of the members in this motivated group. I look forward to creating a helpful applications and absolutly working with these wonderfrul people to learn from each others experience. I think it will be motivating for me personally to see how the group cooperates and find good solutions to the problems we will encounter.

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Creating an application is absolutly somthing new for me, so I want to learn every experience that the group members have and of course improve my humble abilities. In addition, i want to learn how to work in a team and handle complicated situations. It's good to get some work-routine so each person to knows when things should be done and submitted. And absolutly i want to be better in coding.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can willingly ask the team members if they need help. this I can do in meetings or other times. I give help in all possible ways, it can help with coding or just improv an idea to look better. when I help someone i the group I get absolutely happy and in this way others also want to help me when I need help.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 
I f I have some good ideas, I will definitely highlight them for the group, and I will be trying to help the groups scrums in thier problemes, and also I will try to scrum master to get to keep track of the situation in the group, in case everyone is comfortable with the work. And hopefully I will keep track of my part in the work and always try to improve and clearly ask the team if I need help.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I will do my best in this work and do the things i should do without some delays to create a good atmosphere for the group. I will try to get my deliveries on good time to get a wonderful and helpful product as possible.
