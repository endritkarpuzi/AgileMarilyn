Individual reflection.Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about Gitkraken and Android studio.
It would be so interesting to know about those two programs and how they work and which features they have.
So let's say that we want to achieve the goal by understanding the base and going forward.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When we had meeting on zoom, Cezary and Endrit helped us to get start with GitKraken, 
i also did the same thing when Mohammed need help with Gitkraken, we started a zoom meeting, 
it took like 15min and that was enough to get started with the program, also Mohammed helped me to
install the program that we will use to our project “Android Studio”.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I can summarize by saying that the group had meetings on zoom and each group member joined the meeting.
During the meeting we discussed how the Scrum would be, and what it contains.
All the members participated with their suggestions on how the Scrum would be.
With regular meetings and effective discussion we could contribute towards the team’s use of Scrum. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
When it comes to contribution towards the team’s deliveries, we decided it together by having a zoom meeting, 
so we decided that it will be an application that based on one of FN's goals, the app will be on Android Studio. 
So the goal of our application is about how to reduce the climate impact,for example by cooking food, transport,
shopping, etc..The application will be in several language and i will participate in the translation, 
and i will also participate in each detail, in programming (looking forward to learn more programming ), 
giving tips about which alternative is the to do to reduce the climate impact
