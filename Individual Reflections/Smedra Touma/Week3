The week stated by having a meeting with our supervision, The supervisor Hannes gave us tips about how we can do our project better by fixing the backlog and our stories.


Individual Reflection. Week. 3
Smedra Touma

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week we made some mistakes in HelloWorld, we were supposed to do it in Android Studio and i did it in Java.
So the thing I want to learn better and understand fully is how to use Android Studio.
I got some problems by doing the Hello world in Android Studio but the problem was solved finally. 
I also want to learn how Android studio better works.
 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As I mentioned before, we used to have a zoom meeting to get and give help.
And this week we solved the Hello problem together by working together.
We also got help and tips from our supervisor last monday to fix some of the things on backlog and the Helloworld.
If anyone in any time needs help I will be there to do my best to give help in any possible way.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
The team helped each other, the problems that the supervisor told us about, we tried to solve it as a group.
I'll try to work much better next week. I also want to learn more programming in Android studio so that i can help with programming the code for the application.
By watching some youtube tutorial and practice it will surely go well. in this way i can participate in programming the kode.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I delivered a README file that contained HelloWorld. I actually get help to do this in a meeting zoom with the group team.
in the coming week i'll do my best to deliver so much i can and help the group member to do the project as a group.
