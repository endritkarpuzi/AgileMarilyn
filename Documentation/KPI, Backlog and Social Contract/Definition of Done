Definition of Done (DoD)

As a team we define a user story to be done if it meets the followings criteria:
1) Code is finished and builds with no errors
2) Code review is done
3) Implemented feature is tested and usable
4) The user story meets its acceptance criteria;
5) The corresponding developpment git branch is merged 
6) Product owner accepts the finished user story

If all of this criteria are checked we can move the user story card from the "In Progress" section to the "Done" section on our Scrum board.
Therefore the user story is considered as completed.
