Teamreflection week5.

Current situation A
The week started with a meeting with our supervisor Hannes, he gave us feedback about our stories that they must be more clear and read what we mean, because our ideas
are not alligne with what was written, he also mentioned that we should run each other's programs on each other's computer. The group had a meeting after we met with
Hannes, and in our meeting we decided what we should do during the week, we devided the work in two groups consistning of:
Group A: Mohammed, Endrit and Cezary doing the Card-slide system.
Group B: Firel, Alexis and Smedra doing the Notification together with the database.
Each group had their own meeting to move on, and right now we are developing the pragramming of the applications.

B.
We are expecting to be finished with the foundation of the application until next week. We want to be done with the basic functionality, and
only have to fine tune solution, and begin adding the tips and translate the application.

A->B  In order to reduce the gap we need to become beter in communicating and do it better in scheduling, we need to set more specific deadlines
and have clear idea of what we want to deliver for each week


KPI:
Productivity: 3.5 of 5 Some member had to wait until the base for their work should we be delivered 
the productivity will be reflected in the individual reflection.

Stress levels: 3 of 5 
Both groups were stressed in the beggning since we didnt have a clear view at how long certain story would take and were unsure whether or not we would be able
to meet the deadline.

Team satisfaction: The produktivity levels are different from member to member since it had (2.5)
the team satisfaction will be reflected in the individual reflection.


Social contact:
We think we followed most of the rules we set for each other, the circumstances have been a bit different this week, the effort has been different betwwen the members.


Design Desicion and code quality.
We haven't had any code reviews yet so we haven't had a way to ensure the code quality. As soon as the two bigger tasks (slide cards and notifications) are finished, 
we will tie them together so that they are integrated in the application and then we will also have a collective code review.


Scrum
Regarding the Scrum method, we had some criticism and ideas from Hannes for our Scrum board and stories which weren't too well defined. We've tried to fix them and define
them even more thorougly.
We try to have meetings each Sunday to discuss how things have gone and discuss whether or not something hasn't gone as well and try to find a common solution going forward.
For example we believed that the two most critical tasks were a bit too big to handle individually and that it would take too much focus to do them as a whole group,
so we've decided to split these two in two smaller teams.


Since we decided to work in the most critical stories in smaller teams of three, a few members have put in a bit more work than others this week.
This is due to a few different reasons and will be reflected upon more in the individual reflections.
