week 5 Individual reflection

The current situation is  that my group is now responsible for the notification and the database and to connect them together.
I can say that we almost succeeded with that and did a good job this week. I would rate the productivity this week 4.2 of 5. 
about the stress level i would say 3.3 of 5
The week started intensely and we were little stressed about programming and getting into the application but with getting a lot of help from each other
it became less stressed.

The plan is to be done with the base and we can say that we should be finishing a big part of the application.

A->B As a group we should be better in communicating with the group members, we should also keep the same pace to achieve the goal.


What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would say i’m getting better in learning Android studio and better with Github
I would like to be knowledgeable in the application and know everything about it. I would even like to be better about how to reflect and think deeply.
A->B practice in programming more and try to reflect over and over.
 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week our group had good cooperation, that’s because we are comfortable with each other, we get helped and we helped each other.
to do the best by maybe meeting in real life to get the most help
A->B have more meeting, more like regular meeting together and decide time, and keep the time it's the most important thing 
 
 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
this week i have been working on doing notification, me Alexis and Firel did this part but there is little part we are not sure about so we will fix it during next week.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Firel and I did the notification in two different ways we tried Firels and it worked very well, so we will also try mine to see wich one is better to work with
