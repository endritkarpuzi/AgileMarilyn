Week1. Individual reflection.


-This course is such a big course, it includes many things that we can learn. Some of those things are that I want to learn the mindset, how to think when we solve problems and even to practice more on coding. I also want to teach myself to have deadlines and have a good teamwork with my team members 


- I can help my team members by giving each other advice about how to solve a problem, we have had two zoom meeting, anytime if any of my group members want me to help him/her i would rather meet them on Zoom to explain better and then discuss to learn more, i would like to say discussion is the best way to teach and learn. I’ll try to do my best to give what I have to make my team satisfied.


-When it comes to my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum is ensure to do my tasks and be finished on time to make sure that if anybody in the group members needs help so i can help them to be finished. if it happens that i'm not finished with my task i’ll try to do my best for the next task


-Regarding how I can help the team, try to be in each meeting, and always have questions in mind to ask them at the end of the meeting,what have we done from the last meeting,  which problems do we have, and what should we do next. By those questions we can make sure that everyone actually help and do something for the group.
