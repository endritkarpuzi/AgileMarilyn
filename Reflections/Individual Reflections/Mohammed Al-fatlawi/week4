Our first meeting this week we decided that we needed to know how to use andriod studio so we all had to make our own home screen for the app to learn how to use the program 
and we would choose the best one. I did mine but it took me sometime to undestand how the program works and how to best use it. I had some problems with emulator where it wouldnt
want to start my application because there was aproblem. I still havent figured the way to fix the problem, but i inted to ask my fellow group members for a way to fix it. But I 
have learned alot this week and everyone has done some great work with their designs. 
Here are the answeared qustions for this week:

What do I want to learn or understand better?:
I want to coninue to learn how the emulator works, because its there were i have the largest problems that i face, I also want to expand on my idea to the team. I also want to 
learn how to make the second page for the app and how to put in slide cards in there for the information part of the app.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?:
By brining the problems that i face, becuase maybe they face the same problem and we can fix them together, an example of this is my emulator, me and alexis helped eachtohers 
because we had the same problem

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We all attended the agreed upon meetings, I also helped form the teamrefelction by discussing it with the other group members.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?:
I made a homescreen with text and scrolbar, i also degined it to look good, as did everyone in the group.
