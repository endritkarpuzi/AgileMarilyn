    <string name="transporttip1">Walk for short trips.
        \n\nWalking helps reduce body fat, lower blood pressure and is free.
        It may also take less time than you think.

        \n\nStudies have shown that most people will underestimate time related to car
        journeys and overestimate the time it will take to walk.
        \n\nThe average walking pace is six kilometres per hour and
        if you walk you don’t need to find a car bay when you arrive.</string>
    <string name="transporttip2">
        \n\nOpt for the bike
        \n\nSwitching a 10km journey per week from your car to your bike will burn around 300 calories each way and can save
        over 300kg of greenhouse gas emissions each year.
        \n\nDid you know? Peak hour city trips up to 10km in length are generally faster by bike than any other form of transport,
        door to door.
        \n\nIn addition cycling helps reducing body fat, which is a first step to become healthier and stronger!</string>
    <string name="transporttip3">
        Use public transport
        \n\nUsing public transport allows you to skip the hassle of traffic and parking and still be on time!</string>
    <string name="transporttip4">
        Plan before taking trips
        \n\nCollect your errands in one trip to save fuel, money and time!
        \n\nIt will allow you to become more productive during the rest of the day.</string>
    <string name="transporttip5">
        Switch to Green driving
        \n\nDrive smoothly, starting and stopping uses more fuel.
        \n\nSlow down, driving at 90 km/h uses 25% less fuel than travelling at 110 km/h.
        \n\nRegularly check your tyre pressure. Under-inflated tyres can increase fuel consumption by 3%
        and take 10,000km off the tyres life.
        \n\nInstead of using the air conditioner open the window when driving under 70km/h.</string>
    <string name="transporttip6">
        Take one car
        \n\nInstead of taking several cars to make the same trip with your friends, take a single car.
        \n\nYou will enjoy your trip
        even more and it allows you to switch seats with the driver to make your travel safer and more comfortable.
        \n\nYou can always opt for car-pooling if travelling alone to break the monotony of your daily commute.</string>
    <string name="transporttip7">
        Save your money
        \n\nHaving a car costs a lot nowadays, the fuel is pretty expensive and the congestion tax in Sweden becomes
        more expensive every year so think twice before buying your own car!</string>

    <string name="outdoorstip3">
        \n\nEarth-Friendly Outdoor Lighting


        \n\nOutdoor lighting is actually one of the easiest steps to make when it comes to creating a green living space,
        because solar-powered outdoor lights are widely available and can be purchased at nearly any garden center or home store.
        \n\nMake sure you purchase all-natural options that are made from soy wax or beeswax and scented with essential oils

</string>
    <string name="outdoorstip4">

    <string name="outdoorstip5">
        \n\nDo not smoke in public places
        \n\nSmoking affects both the environment and people in a negative way. \n\nstudies have shown
        that tobacco production causes forest losses, and this causes the amount of carbon dioxide to increase in
        the atmosphere

    </string>
    <string name="outdoorstip6">
        \n\nStop using hair spray
        hair spray and other perfumed products have negative consequences for the environment, then
        perfumes are not broken down but many continue into the waterways. \n\nWhich
        makes an unnecessary burden on the treatment plants.

    </string>
    <string name="outdoorstip7">
