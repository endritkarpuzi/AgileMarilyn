    <string name="transporttip1">
        \n\nWalk for short trips
        \n\nWalking helps reduce body fat, lower blood pressure and is free.
        It may also take less time than you think.

        \n\nStudies have shown that most people will underestimate time related to car
        journeys and overestimate the time it will take to walk.
        \n\nThe average walking pace is six kilometres per hour and
        if you walk you don’t need to find a car bay when you arrive.</string>
    <string name="transporttip2">
        \n\nOpt for the bike
        \n\nSwitching a 10km journey per week from your car to your bike will burn around 300 calories each way and can save
        over 300kg of greenhouse gas emissions each year.
        \n\nDid you know? Peak hour city trips up to 10km in length are generally faster by bike than any other form of transport,
        door to door.
        \n\nIn addition cycling helps reducing body fat, which is a first step to become healthier and stronger!</string>

        \n\nUse public transport
        \n\nUsing public transport allows you to skip the hassle of traffic and parking and still be on time!</string>
    <string name="transporttip4">
        \n\nPlan before taking trips
        \n\nCollect your errands in one trip to save fuel, money and time!

>>>>>>> development_smedra
        \n\nDrive smoothly, starting and stopping uses more fuel.
        \n\nSlow down, driving at 90 km/h uses 25% less fuel than travelling at 110 km/h.
        \n\nRegularly check your tyre pressure. Under-inflated tyres can increase fuel consumption by 3%
        and take 10,000km off the tyres life.
        \n\nInstead of using the air conditioner open the window when driving under 70km/h.</string>
    <string name="transporttip6">
<<<<<<< HEAD
        \n\nTake one car
        \n\nInstead of taking several cars to make the same trip with your friends, take a single car whenever it is possible.

        \n\nYou will enjoy your trip
        even more and it allows you to switch seats with the driver to make your travel safer and more comfortable.
        \n\nYou can always opt for car-pooling if travelling alone to break the monotony of your daily commute.</string>

        Save your money
>>>>>>> development_smedra
        \n\nHaving a car costs a lot nowadays, the fuel is pretty expensive and the congestion tax in Sweden becomes
        more expensive every year so think twice before buying your own car!</string>

    <string name="householdtip2">
        \n\nUse cold water when washing your clothes
        \n\nAn estimated 75 to 90 percent of all the energy your washer uses goes to warming up the water,
        so switching to colder water can lower your gas or electric bill.
	    \n\nIn addition hot water will actually set stains, and cold water will get your clothes just as clean.



    </string>
    <string name="householdtip3">
        \n\nMake your own cleaning products
        \n\nReplace all your plastic chemical containers with a single one.
        \n\n*Window cleaner: 1/4 cup of white vinegar, 2 cups of warm water and tea tree oil
        \n\n*Anti-bacterial cleaner: 1/4 cup of white vinegar, 1 tbsp of baking soda, 1 litre of hot water and orange essential oils
    </string>
    <string name="householdtip4">
        \n\nInsulate your home
	    \n\nHomes that aren\'t well insulated are much harder to keep warm when it\'s cold, and cool when the weather is hot.

        \n\nTurn off lights when you leave the room
        \n\nThis is surely one of the most know tips you can hear from anyone.
        Turning the lights off when you\'re not using them can help save money by reducing your electricity bills and extend the
        life of your light bulbs.
        \n\nDoing so can make your home more energy-efficient.

        \n\nEat less meat
	    \n\nNot having red meat, even if it’s just for two or three days a week - can have quite a significant impact on reducing your carbon footprint.
</string>
    <string name="householdtip7">
        \n\nRecycle everything
	    \n\nYou can recycle almost everything, from batteries to paper to cars. Before you throw it away, take a minute to find out if you could recycle it instead.

</string>
    <string name="worklifetip2">
        \n\nGo paperless!

        \n\nSwitch to digital documents instead of paper, and think over of buying 100€ recycled paper.
</string>
    <string name="worklifetip3">
        \n\nGreen cleansing

        \n\nMany cleansing products are environmentally unfriendly and are dangerous for the environment as well as human health.
        \n\nPrioritize buying eco friendly hand soap and sprays that don\'t have harmful and other bad chemicals.
</string>
    <string name="worklifetip4">
        \n\nNo more water bottles

        \n\nYou can easily drink water from your own glass, or if you decide to purchase a reusable water bottle.

        \n\nPlan you work day

        \n\nPrepare your meals and snacks the day before you work, so you don\'t need to drive to buy food or
        other stuff.
</string>
    <string name="worklifetip6">
        \n\nUse public transport

        \n\nThe best solution to reduce emissions is to use public transport, and if it\'s not possible then
        take your bike and cycle to work.
</string>
    <string name="worklifetip7">
        \n\nHave green decoration

        \n\nEarth-Friendly Outdoor Lighting


        \n\nOutdoor lighting is actually one of the easiest steps to make when it comes to creating a green living space,
        because solar-powered outdoor lights are widely available and can be purchased at nearly any garden center or home store.
        \n\nMake sure you purchase all-natural options that are made from soy wax or beeswax and scented with essential oils

>>>>>>> development_smedra
</string>
    <string name="outdoorstip4">
        \n\nDo not throw rubbish on the ground
        \n\nSome kinds of rubbish have an impressively long decomposition time.
        \n\nEspecially do not throw batteries which can have a very bad effect on nature, and should be recycled.
        \n\nBirds can get stuck on chewing gum on the ground on the street, and that can lead to them getting hit by cars.
        Another well known consequence of throwing rubbish (in the oceans) are seals getting trapped in plastic rubbish and very often dying because of it.

    <string name="outdoorstip5">
        \n\nDo not smoke in public places
        \n\nSmoking affects both the environment and people\'s health in a negative way.
        \n\nStudies have shown that tobacco production causes forest losses, and this causes the amount of carbon dioxide to increase in
        the atmosphere

    </string>
    <string name="outdoorstip6">
        \n\nStop using hair spray
        \n\nHair spray and other perfumed products have negative consequences for the environment.
        The perfumes are not broken down but many continue into the waterways, which
        makes an unnecessary burden on the treatment plants.
